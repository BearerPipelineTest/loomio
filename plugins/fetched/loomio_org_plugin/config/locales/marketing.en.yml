    who_owns_the_data:
      question: Who owns my group’s data?
      answer: |
        You do! Unlike some other services, we're not in the advertising business. You are the customer, not the product, and you're in charge.
        Loomio is open source software, and your data is portable and exportable. You can download a CSV and open it in a spreadsheet or even export your entire group history and run it on your own Loomio server - if you have the skillset, time and resources.

    where_is_loomio_org_hosted:

    can_we_trust_you:
      question: Why should we trust Loomio?
      answer: |
        We've been in business for more than 8 years. We have great relationships with our customers. We're a worker-owned cooperative - which means the people who create Loomio also have ownership in it.
        We work with investors who support our social mission, and are committed to ensuring we provide the highest level of privacy and protection for our customer’s data.
        To the best of our knowledge, we've never had an attacker steal any of our customers' data.
